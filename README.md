# LVinnamon-Project

The LVinnamon Project is an ongoing group project assigned for the Web-Based Application Development Laboratory course in the fourth semester of the Information System program at Bina Nusantara for B25 students. The project requires the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its development and aims to be a Responsive Web Design (RWD). The LVinnamon Project is still heavily under development which may cause significant changes to both appearance and source codes.
